The `.Rproj` file is a project file for RStudio and it is not written in R or any other programming language. It's a type of file that contains metadata about your workspace. This includes the version of R that you're using, your working directory, workspace history, and any project-specific options. 

This file is usually auto-generated when you create a new project in RStudio and it's not meant to be manually edited, so it doesn't contain R code. Therefore, I can't provide you with the code for this file. However, you can easily create it by opening RStudio and going to File > New Project.
